# Overview

ANZ technical zeyu

## 1. Pre-requirements (to be setup locally)

### 1.1 Git

assuming you are familiar with git (and already have git installed and configured)
```
git clone https://github.com/Shuliyey/technical-tests.git
cd technical-tests
```

### 1.2 Local build environment requirements
below terminal **applications/tools** needs to be installed

* bash
* docker
* make
* curl
* golint
* kubernetes-cli (kubectl)

## 2. Tasks/Steps

### 2.1 Q1 - Dockerfile Multistage Build and Optmisation

The finalised `Dockerfile` is available at [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile)

* multi-stage build
  * the `builder` section will be responsible of producing the final application binary `/app/golang-test`
  * the final docker image uses `alpine` as the minimal based image and port the final application `/app/golang-test` produced by the `builder` section. This keeps the final image at its minimum, as the runtime image doesn not need a full dependency to build the application
* cache optmisation
  * `Dockerfile` structure has been designed to achieve cache optmisation as it puts the static defined steps before the dynamic dependend steps, meaning the static steps will be cached for optmisation

### 2.2 Q2 Ì¨- Application, Containerisation and CICD pipeline

#### 2.2.1 make

* build docker image

```bash
make docker.build
```

* run docker image

```bash
make docker.run
```

**Note: make sure the `HOST_PORT` is available and not in use by other processes**

there'll be message indicating the `local url` to visit (**running in local mode (docker run), visit app at localhost:`HOST_PORT`/version**), below is an example

#### 2.2.2 github-actions

cicd pipeline is implemented in [github actions](https://github.com/features/actions), pipeline is defined in [.github/workflows/go.yml](.github/workflows/go.yml)

list of triggered pipelines can be visited on the repo's github-actions page (https://github.com/Shuliyey/technical-tests/actions)

![anz technical zeyu q1 github actions pipelines](readme/technical-tests-q1-github-actions-pipelines.png)

below are two examples of triggered pipelines

* [448653554](https://github.com/Shuliyey/technical-tests/runs/448653554?check_suite_focus=true) (on push to `master` branch)
* [448540674](https://github.com/Shuliyey/technical-tests/runs/448540674?check_suite_focus=true) (on push `'v*'` tags)

#### 2.2.3 info
refer to [q1-application-containerisation-and-cicd-pipeline](readme/q1-application-containerisation-and-cicd-pipeline.md) **(note: don't have to read this, just need to run the `make` tasks, they're self explanatory)**. Docker `multistage` build is used to optimise the application image, by default the application image runs under user `nobody` (**no** `root` permission) for enhanced application security at run time

### 2.3 Extra - Deployments (Kubernetes)

#### 2.3.1 make

assuming your local `kubectl` is already pointing to the desired kubernetes context (this can be verified through `kubectl config current-context`)

* deploy application manifests to kubernetes

```bash
make up
```

**there'll be a section (like below) indicating the endpoint to visit the application and more information such as tailing the application service logs**

![anz techical zeyu q2 screenshot make up endpoint](readme/technical-tests-q2-screenshot-make-up-endpoint.png)

* remove application manifests from kubernetes

```bash
make down
```

* more info refer to [q2-kubernetes](readme/q2-kubernetes.md) **(note: the `make up` and `make down` are self explanatory and does the creation and removal of the required application resources on kubernetes, this is just for more reference)**
